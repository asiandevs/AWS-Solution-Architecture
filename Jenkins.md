Title: DevOps Training: Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

**Objective:**
The objective of this training is to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins. By the end of this training, participants should be able to set up, configure, and automate CI/CD pipelines for their software projects using Jenkins.

**Duration:** 2 Days
